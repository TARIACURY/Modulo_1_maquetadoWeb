            <h2 id="Introduccion">1.Introduction</h2>
            <p>Please read these Terms of Use ("Terms") carefully as they govern your use of (which includes access to) Spotify's personalized services for streaming music and other content, including all of our websites and software applications that incorporate or link to these Terms (collectively, the "Spotify Service") and any music, videos, podcasts, audiobooks, or other material that is made available through the Spotify Service ("Content").</p>
            <p>Use of the Spotify Service is subject to the Spotify Privacy Policy and additional terms and conditions presented by Spotify, all of which are made part of these Terms by this reference.</p>  
            <p>By signing up for, or otherwise using, the Spotify Service, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, then you must not use the Spotify Service or access any Content.</p>  
            <p>THESE TERMS CONTAIN A MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISION THAT, AS FURTHER SET FORTH IN SECTION 6 BELOW, REQUIRES THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR ANY OTHER COURT PROCEEDINGS, OR CLASS ACTIONS OF ANY KIND. IN ARBITRATION THERE IS LESS DISCOVERY AND APPELLATE REVIEW THAN IN COURT.</p>
            <p><strong>Service provider</strong></p>
            <p>These Terms are between you and Spotify USA Inc., 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, NY, 10007.</p>
            <p><strong>Age and eligibility requirements</strong></p>
            <p>BY USING THE SPOTIFY SERVICE, YOU AFFIRM THAT YOU ARE 18 YEARS OR OLDER TO ENTER INTO THESE TERMS, OR, IF YOU ARE NOT, THAT YOU ARE 13 YEARS OR OLDER AND HAVE OBTAINED PARENTAL OR GUARDIAN CONSENT TO ENTER INTO THESE TERMS. Additionally, in order to use the Spotify Service and access any Content, you represent that: you reside in the United States, and any registration and account information that you submit to Spotify is true, accurate, and complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times.</p>

            <h2 id="The Spotify Service">2. The Spotify Service</h2>
            <p>Spotify Service options</p>
            <p>We provide numerous Spotify Service options. Certain Spotify Service options are provided free of charge, while other options require payment before they can be accessed ("Paid Subscriptions"). We may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services. We are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties.</p>
            <p>Trials</p>
            <p>From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate ("Trial"). By using a Spotify Service via a Trial, you agree to the Spotify Paid Subscription Terms.</p>
            <p>Third-party applications, devices and open source software</p>
            <p>The Spotify Service may be integrated with, or may otherwise interact with, third-party applications, websites, and services ("Third-Party Applications") and third-party personal computers, mobile handsets, tablets, wearable devices, speakers, and other devices ("Devices"). Your use of such Third-Party Applications and Devices may be subject to additional terms, conditions, and policies provided to you by the applicable third party. Spotify does not guarantee that Third-Party Applications and Devices will be compatible with the Spotify Service.</p>
            <p>Service limitations and modifications</p>
            <p>We use reasonable efforts to keep the Spotify Service operational and to provide you with a personalized, immersive audio experience. However, Spotify reserves the right to change our Spotify Service offerings and their availability from time to time, without notice or liability to you. For example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Spotify Service may experience temporary interruptions due to technical difficulties, maintenance or testing, or updates, including those required to reflect changes in relevant laws and regulatory requirements.</li>
                <li>We aim to evolve and improve the Spotify Service constantly, and we may modify, suspend, or stop (permanently or temporarily) providing all or part of the Spotify Service (including particular functions, features, subscription plans, and promotional offerings).</li>
                <li>Spotify has no obligation to provide any specific content through the Spotify Service, and Spotify or the applicable owners may remove particular songs, videos, podcasts, and other Content without notice.</li>
            </ul> 
            <p>If you have prepaid fees directly to Spotify for a Paid Subscription that Spotify permanently discontinues prior to the end of your Prepaid Period (as that term is defined in the "Payments and cancellations" section below), Spotify will refund you the prorated portion of the prepaid fees for the Pre-Paid Period after such discontinuation. Your account and billing information must be up to date in order for us to refund you.</p>
            <p>Spotify has no liability to you, nor any obligation to provide a refund to you, in connection with internet or other Spotify Service outages or failures that are caused by the actions of government authorities, other third parties, or events beyond our control.</p>

            <h2 id="Your Use of the Spotify Service">3. Your Use of the Spotify Service</h2>
            <p>Creating a Spotify account</p>
            <p>You may need to create a Spotify account to use all or part of the Spotify Service. Your username and password are for your personal use only and should be kept confidential. You understand that you are responsible for all use (including any unauthorized use) of your username and password. Notify our Customer Service team immediately if your username or password is lost or stolen, or if you believe there has been unauthorized access to your account.</p>
            <p>Spotify may reclaim, or require you to change, your username for any reason.</p>
            <p>Your rights to use the Spotify Service</p>
            <p>Access to the Spotify Service</p>
            <p>Subject to your compliance with these Terms (including any other applicable terms and conditions), we grant to you limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make personal, non-commercial use of the Spotify Service and the Content (collectively, "Access"). This Access shall remain in effect unless and until terminated by you or Spotify. You agree that you will not redistribute or transfer the Spotify Service or the Content.</p>
            <p>The Spotify software applications and the Content are licensed, not sold or transferred to you, and Spotify and its licensors retain ownership of all copies of the Spotify software applications and Content even after installation on your Devices.</p>
            <p>Spotify's proprietary rights</p>
            <p>The Spotify Service and the Content are the property of Spotify or Spotify's licensors. All Spotify trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, domain names, and any other features of the Spotify brand ("Spotify Brand Features") are the sole property of Spotify or its licensors. These Terms do not grant you any rights to use any Spotify Brand Features whether for commercial or non-commercial use.</p>
            <p>You agree to abide by the Spotify User Guidelines and not to use the Spotify Service, the Content, or any part thereof in any manner not expressly permitted by these Terms.</p>
            <p>Payments and cancellation</p>
            <p>Billing</p>
            <p>You may purchase a Paid Subscription directly from Spotify or through a third party either by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>paying a subscription fee plus applicable taxes in advance on a monthly basis or some other recurring interval disclosed to you prior to your purchase; or</li>
                <li>prepayment giving you access to the Spotify Service for a specific time period ("Prepaid Period").</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Tax rates are calculated based on the information you provide and the applicable rate at the time of your monthly charge.</p>
            <p>If you purchase access to a Paid Subscription through a third party, separate terms and conditions with such third party may apply to your use of the Spotify Service in addition to these Terms. Please contact the third party regarding any refunds or to manage your subscription. If you purchase a Paid Subscription using a code, gift card, pre-paid offer, or other offer provided or sold by or on behalf of Spotify for access to a Paid Subscription ("Codes"), you hereby agree to the Spotify Card Terms.</p>
            <p>If you purchase Audiobook Content outside of your Paid Subscription, your purchase will be governed by the Audiobook Purchase Terms and Conditions.</p>
            <p>Price and tax changes</p>
            <p>Spotify may from time to time make changes to Paid Subscriptions, including recurring subscription fees, the Prepaid Period (for periods not yet paid), or Codes, and will communicate any price changes to you in advance. Price changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change and, by continuing to use the Spotify Service after the price change takes effect, you will have accepted the new price. If you do not agree to a price change, you can reject the change by unsubscribing from the applicable Paid Subscription prior to the price change going into effect.</p>
            <p>Tax rates are based on the rates applicable at the time of your monthly charge. These amounts can change over time with local tax requirements in your country, state, territory, county, or city. Any change in tax rate will be automatically applied based on the account information you provide.</p>
            <p>Renewal and cancellation</p>
            <p>With the exception of Paid Subscriptions for a Prepaid Period, your payment to Spotify or the third party through which you purchased the Paid Subscription will automatically renew at the end of the applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your Paid Subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period. Contact our Customer Support team here for instructions on how to cancel. The cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the free version of the Spotify Service. We do not provide refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods, except as expressly stated in these Terms.</p>
            <p>If you have purchased a Paid Subscription using a Code, your subscription will automatically terminate at the end of the period stated with your Code, or when there is an insufficient prepaid balance to pay for the Spotify Service.</p>
            <p>User guidelines</p>
            <p>We've established guidelines for using the Spotify Service, to make sure the Spotify Service stays enjoyable for everyone ("Spotify User Guidelines"). In using the Spotify Service, you must comply with the Spotify User Guidelines, as well as all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, and respect the intellectual property, privacy, and other rights of third parties.</p>
            <p>Brand accounts</p>
            <p>If you establish a Spotify account on behalf of a company, organization, entity, or brand ( "Brand," and such account a "Brand Account"), the terms "you" and "your," as used throughout these Terms (including other Spotify terms and conditions incorporated by reference herein), apply to both you and the Brand.</p>
            <p>If you create a Brand Account, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to grant all permissions and licenses provided in these Terms (including any other applicable Spotify terms and conditions) and to bind the Brand to these Terms.</p>
            <p>A Brand may follow users and create and share playlists, provided that the Brand does not take any action that implies an endorsement or commercial relationship between the Brand and the followed user, artist, songwriter, or any other person, unless the Brand has independently obtained the rights to imply such an endorsement. In addition, Brands must be transparent to our users about disclosing any endorsements or consideration provided to artists, songwriters, users, or any other party and must comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and codes of practice when engaging in the foregoing practices.</p>
            <p>Export control and sanctions</p>
            <p>Certain Spotify products and services are subject to trade control laws, including the export control and economic sanctions laws of the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom and other jurisdictions, including but not limited to the Export Administration Regulations maintained by the U.S. Department of Commerce, trade and economic sanctions maintained by the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC"), the International Traffic in Arms Regulations maintained by the U.S. Department of State, Regulation 2021/821 as amended (EU Dual-Use Regulation), the UK Export Control Act 2002 and the UK Export Control Order 2008 (collectively, "Trade Control Laws"). You represent and warrant that you are (1) not located in, organized under the laws of, or ordinarily resident in any country or territory subject to territorial sanctions ("Sanctioned Country"), nor are you owned by or acting on behalf of a Government subject to asset-blocking sanctions or any person or entity organized, located or ordinarily resident in a Sanctioned Country; and (2) not a person identified on, or more than 50% owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by or acting on behalf or at the direction of any entity identified on, U.S., E.U., U.K., or other applicable government restricted party lists, such as the Specially Designated Nationals List maintained by OFAC, the Consolidated list of persons, groups and entities subject to EU financial sanctions, or the UK Consolidated List.</p>
            <p>You agree to comply with all applicable Trade Control Laws in your use of the Spotify Service. Specifically, you agree not to, directly or indirectly, use, sell, supply, export, reexport, transfer, divert, release, or otherwise dispose of any products, software, or technology (including products derived from or based on such technology) received from Spotify under these Terms to any destination, entity, or person or for any end use prohibited by applicable Trade Controls Laws. Spotify shall not be required to act in any way that is prohibited under applicable Trade Control Laws, and it shall be in the sole discretion of Spotify to refrain from being directly or indirectly involved in the provision of products or services that may be prohibited under applicable Trade Control Laws.</p>

            <p>The content you post on the Spotify Service</p>

            <p>User Content</p>
            <p>You retain ownership of your User Content when you post it to the Spotify Service. However, in order for us to make your User Content available on the Spotify Service, we do need a limited license from you to that User Content. Accordingly, you hereby grant to Spotify a non-exclusive, transferable, sublicensable, royalty-free, fully paid, irrevocable, worldwide license to reproduce, make available, perform and display, translate, modify, create derivative works from, distribute, and otherwise use any such User Content through any medium, whether alone or in combination with other Content or materials, in any manner and by any means, method or technology, whether now known or hereafter created, in connection with the Spotify Service. Where applicable and to the extent permitted under applicable law, you also agree to waive, and not to enforce, any "moral rights" or equivalent rights, such as your right to be identified as the author of any User Content, including Feedback, and your right to object to derogatory treatment of such User Content.</p>
            <p>Feedback</p>
            <p>If you provide ideas, suggestions, or other feedback in connection with your use of the Spotify Service or any Content ("Feedback"), such Feedback is not confidential and may be used by Spotify without restriction and without payment to you. Feedback is considered a type of User Content under these Terms.</p>
            <p>Your Device</p>
            <p>You also grant to us the right (1) to allow the Spotify Service to use the processor, bandwidth, and storage hardware on your Device in order to facilitate the operation of the Spotify Service, (2) to provide advertising and other information to you, and (3) to allow our business partners to do the same.</p>
            <p>Content experience</p>
            <p>In any part of the Spotify Service, the Content that you access, including its selection and placement, may be influenced by commercial considerations, including Spotify's agreements with third parties.</p>
            <p>Some Content licensed by, provided to, created by, or otherwise made available by Spotify (e.g., podcasts or shows) may incorporate advertising or other promotional messages.</p>
            <p>Infringement claims</p>
            <p>Spotify respects the rights of intellectual property owners. If you believe that any Content infringes your copyright rights, please see the Spotify Copyright Policy.</p>

            <p>Suspending and terminating the Spotify Service</p>
            <p>These Terms will continue to apply to you until terminated by either you or Spotify. Spotify may terminate these Terms (including any additional terms and conditions incorporated herein) or suspend your access to the Spotify Service at any time if we believe you have breached any of these Terms, if we stop providing the Spotify Service or any material component thereof, or as we believe necessary to comply with applicable law. If you or Spotify terminate these Terms, or if Spotify suspends your access to the Spotify Service, you agree that Spotify shall have no liability or responsibility to you, and (except as expressly provided in these Terms) Spotify will not refund any amounts that you have already paid. You may terminate these Terms at any time, in which case you may not continue accessing or using the Spotify Service. To learn how to terminate your Spotify account, please use the Customer Support resources on our About Us page.</p>

            <p>Warranty disclaimers</p>
            <p>THE SPOTIFY SERVICE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE," WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY. FURTHER, SPOTIFY AND ALL OWNERS OF THE CONTENT DISCLAIM ANY EXPRESS, IMPLIED, AND STATUTORY WARRANTIES REGARDING THE CONTENT, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.

NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION WHETHER ORAL OR IN WRITING OBTAINED BY YOU FROM SPOTIFY SHALL CREATE ANY WARRANTY ON BEHALF OF SPOTIFY. WHILE USING THE SPOTIFY SERVICE, YOU MAY HAVE ACCESS TO EXPLICIT CONTENT FILTERING FEATURES, BUT USE OF THESE FEATURES MAY STILL RESULT IN SOME EXPLICIT CONTENT BEING SERVED AND YOU SHOULD NOT RELY ON SUCH FEATURES TO FILTER ALL EXPLICIT CONTENT. THIS SECTION APPLIES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.</p>
            <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitations on applicable statutory rights of a consumer, so the exclusion and limitations in this section may not apply to you.</p>

            <p>For clarification, these Terms do not limit Spotify's liability for fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation, death or personal injury to the extent that applicable law would prohibit such a limitation.</p>

            <p>Third-party rights</p>

("Apple") App Store or if you are using the App on an iOS device, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to the following notice regarding Apple.

In the event of any failure of the Spotify Service to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify Apple and Apple will refund the applicable purchase price for the App to you; and, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple has no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the Spotify Service.

You agree to comply with any applicable third-party terms, when using the Spotify Service.

            <h2 id="About These Terms">7. About These Terms</h2>
            <p>Under applicable law, you may have certain rights that can't be limited by a contract. These Terms are in no way intended to restrict those rights.</p>
            <p>Changes</p>
            <p>We may make changes to these Terms (including any additional Spotify terms and conditions incorporated by reference herein) from time to time by notifying you of such changes by any reasonable means, including by posting the revised Terms on the applicable Spotify Service (provided that, for material changes, we will seek to supplement such notice by email, an in-service pop-up message, or other prominent notice within the Spotify Service, or other means). Your use of the Spotify Service following any changes to these Terms will constitute your acceptance of such changes. Premium Subscribers who do not wish to continue using the Spotify Service under the updated Terms must close their Spotify account prior to their renewal date or thirty (30) days after the Effective Date, whichever occurs first. If Spotify makes any material change to the Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the notice address), you may reject any such change by sending us a personally signed, written notice of your decision to opt out of those changes via email to tounotice@spotify.com. This opt-out notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of when we notify users of the change and include: (1) your name, address, email address associated with your Spotify account, phone number, and Spotify username. Such an opt-out must be sent by you personally from your personal email address, and not by your agent, attorney, or anyone else purporting to act on your behalf. The opt-out notice also must include a statement that you wish to reject the change to the Arbitration Agreement. Opting out of a material change to the Arbitration Agreement is not an opt-out of arbitration altogether. Even if you opt out of a material change to the Arbitration Agreement, you and Spotify agree that any Dispute will be determined by binding individual (not class) arbitration in accordance with the Arbitration Agreement in effect immediately before any such opt-out.</p>
            <p>Entire agreement</p>
            <p>Other than as stated in this section or as explicitly agreed upon in writing between you and Spotify, these Terms constitute all the terms and conditions agreed upon between you and Spotify and supersede any prior agreements in relation to the subject matter of these Terms, whether written or oral. As noted above, other terms and conditions governing use of the Spotify Service are incorporated herein by reference, including the following terms and conditions: Spotify Paid Subscription Terms; Spotify Audiobook Purchase Terms and Conditions; Spotify's Card Terms; Spotify User Guidelines; Spotify Copyright Policy; and Spotify Support Community Terms.</p>
            <p>Severability and waiver</p>
            <p>Unless as otherwise stated in these Terms, should any provision of these Terms be held invalid or unenforceable for any reason or to any extent, the remaining provisions of these Terms will not be affected, and the application of that provision shall be enforced to the extent permitted by law.</p>
            <p>Any failure by Spotify or any third-party beneficiary to enforce these Terms or any provision thereof shall not waive Spotify's or the applicable third-party beneficiary's right to do so.</p>
            <p>Assignment</p>
            <p>Spotify may assign any or all of these Terms, and may assign or delegate, in whole or in part, any of its rights or obligations under these Terms. You may not assign these Terms, in whole or in part, nor transfer or sublicense your rights under these Terms to any third party.</p>
